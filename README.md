üìú Project Overview
The Lost and Found API is designed to allow users to report lost or found items on a centralized platform. Users can register, log in, and manage their lost or found reports. Authentication is handled using JWT tokens for secure access, while the data is stored using MongoDB. This project is ideal for universities or community groups looking for a platform to track lost and found items.

üåü Features
User Registration & Authentication: Users can sign up and log in securely. Passwords are hashed, and authentication is handled via JWT tokens.
Lost/Found Item Reports: Users can create, retrieve, and filter lost or found items based on specific criteria (e.g., status, location).
JWT-Protected Routes: Ensure that only authenticated users can report new items.
Efficient Searching: Items can be searched using filters like item name, status, and found/deposit location.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error-handling middleware for better debugging and user feedback.
